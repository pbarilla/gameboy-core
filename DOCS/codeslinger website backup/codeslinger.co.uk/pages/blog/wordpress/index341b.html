			<h2>Testing does not prove the absence of bugs, only the presence</h2>

				<p>If any of you are writing a Z80 emulator then take it from me dont rely on zexall too much. If zexalls output says you have a bug then you most definately do. However if it says that the test went ok it doesnt mean that they are bug free.</p>
<p>I managed to fix a bug in my emulator without zexalls help which was causing a few games to display the background incorrectly. Mainly Lemmings and Land of Illusion. This bug has been haunting me for awhile so im quite relieved to have fixed it.</p>
<p>I have recently found out that some games run at the wrong speed with my emulator so after checking all my opcodes to see if they are emulating their cycles correctly I was left with the conclusion it must be an error with my vsync emultion. Sure enough I wasnt moving on to the next scanline quick enough which was causing too few vsync interrupts to occur which is one of the main way speed is controlled in games. This is now fixed (after a day of headache) and all games play at the correct speed ( or should I say all tested games? <img src='wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> )</p>
<p>Over the past few days I have also emulated the none maskable reset interrupt, the different screen resolution controlled by the current vdp mode and the codemasters mapper. Although the codemasters mapper is implemented correctly the majority of the games show issues with background rendering. However I believe this to be a problem with the background rendering routine rather than the mapper iteself because there is not much room for error with the mapper (compared to the sega mapper anyway).</p>
