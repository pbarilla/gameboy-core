				<p>I have fixed most of the bugs in my CPU emulator and now a lot of games are playable and the majority of them are completeable, which is great news. The only game I know of which is not playable which should be is Lemmings. I have no idea what is happening to this game when I try to emulate it but all the graphics are broke. The only other games that dont work are the ones that use the none standard vdp modes, which is because I&#8217;ve yet to implement them.</p>
<p>Currently my CPU emulator passes 69 of the 70 zexall tests but to be honest I really dont trust zexall that much anymore as I think broken opcodes can still get the thumbs up from zexall. Plus it doesnt check all the instruction like Calls, Jumps, Returns and Exchanges. Still it will be nice when all 70 of the zexall tests are passed by my emulator.</p>
<p>Hopefully by the end of this week my emulator will have passed all 70 of the zexall tests as well as having Lemmings workings. I will also try to implement other parts of the emulator which I&#8217;ve left out, like player twos control pad and the reset interupt. When all this is done I will start working on emulating the remaining VDP modes (which I really dont want to do) along with Sound and then finally speed optimizations. So far my emulator is running dog slow, which isnt suprising considering I have not done any optimizations yet. The reason for this is I like leaving optimizations til last and then I can see just how much of a speed improvement each optimization gives.</p>

			<p>Hi, I couldn&#8217;t find anywhere else to contact you, so I&#8217;ll leave this here.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for producing this site, it has been very useful to me. It is about time somebody wrote tutorials on emulator programming with specific examples, rather than just generic emulation concepts and your site is exactly that.</p>
<p>I was planning (and still do) to write some emulator programming tutorials on my blog once I get my head around some of the concepts. I had already written a Chip8 emulator and was planning to write a Gameboy emulator before I found your site, but was struggling with where to begin with the Gameboy emu. Thanks again for providing this great resource.</p>
<p>Andy</p>

			<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for the kind words. Im glad you&#8217;re finding this site helpful. Good luck with your gameboy emulator, it really is a fun project. If you have any questions feel free to leave a comment and I&#8217;ll get back to you.</p>
