			<h2>Gameboy Timing and Timers</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>One of the most important parts of emulator development is the timing emulation. If you get the timing wrong then you will suffer from very low compatibility.</p>
<p>This is the information I have about gameboy timing:</p>
<p>Processor Speed: 1048576Hz (PROCESSORSPEED)</p>
<p>Clock Speed: 4194304Hz (CLOCKSPEED)</p>
<p>It has one timer located at memory address 0xFF05 (TIMA) which counts up at a set frequency. The frequency is dictated by combining bits 1 and 0 of memory address 0xFF07 (TAC) which is the timer control register. Bit 2 of TAC is responsible for stopping and starting the timer (TIMA).</p>
<p>As previously stated combining bit 1 and 0 of TAC specifies the TIMA frequency. These are the frequencies:</p>
<p>00:   4096 Hz</p>
<p>01: 262144 Hz</p>
<p>10:  65536 Hz</p>
<p>11:  16384 Hz</p>
<p>As the TIMA is an unsigned byte it can only count between values of 0 and 255. So when it goes higher than 255 it sets its value to the value stored in the register 0xFF06(TMA) and requests the timer interupt. </p>
<p>All the above information needs to be successfully emulated to give high compatibility. This is how Im going coding it.</p>
<p>I have set my emulator to have a frames per second (FPS) count of 60. This means I must execute <strong>CLOCKSPEED / FPS</strong> number of instruction cycles every 60th of a second. This will give me 4194304Hz of clock cycles every second.</p>
<p>Thats the gameboy timing emulated but what about the gameboy timer? If we take frequency 4096Hz this means the timer increments its value 4096 times a second. As the timer counts between 0 and 255 it must overflow 16 times a second (4096/256). This is handy to know so we can check it is counting at the correct frequency. However how do we know when we need to increment the timer? The clockspeed is 4194304Hz and the frequency is 4096Hz. This means that roughly every 1024 clock cycles the timer increments by 1. So if we have a variable for timer counting (m_TimerTracer) that is initially set to 1024 and each timer we execute an opcode we decrease this variable by the amount of clock cycles the opcode took to execute then when this variable is less than or equal to 0 it is time to incrememt the timer. Of course we only do all of this if bit 2 of TAC is set to 1 (meaning the timer is enabled). This is fine for frequency 4096 but what about the other 3 frequencies? Well whenever the game changes TAC register bits 1 and 0 then m_TimerTracer gets reset to CLOCKSPEED/FREQUENCY. So whenever the game writes to address TAC we need to check that the current frequency is different to the new frequency and if so we change m_TimerTracer to CLOCKSPEED/FREQUENCY.</p>
<p>Putting all of the above information together gives the following emulation code:</p>

			<p>I found your website in Google few moments ago, and luckily, this is it I was looking for the last weeks, thanks</p>
