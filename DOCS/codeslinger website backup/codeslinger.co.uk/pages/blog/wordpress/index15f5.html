		<description>Thanks for making such a comprehensive tutorial.
I've been looking everywhere to find information to start emulation programming without success
Now i've finally found a step by step guide that explains everything very well
Thanks :)</description>

		<description>After watching the i-net for many years, alot of docs become out of date and valuable resources(like yours) vanish, so I only have one suggestion that I hope you implement:

Create a tarball/zip archive of your guide including all docs, tutorials, ect, THAT IS EASILY FOUND AND DOWNLOADED, perhaps placed on your homepage, place it a few places like gamedev, a few forums that allow uploading, and few other top listed sites on google, so if in a few years, life decides to distract you and your time away from here, if your domain goes under, ect.., your stuff will be spread and archived throughout the net and thus your true goal as stated will have survived:  THE PROPAGATION OF EMULATION KNOWLEDGE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION, 

THANKS!

ps,
If you post the archive to the homepage with a version number(.2999 perhaps for chip8,gameboy,sms(without vdp)), I'll do a good portion of the preservation work for you.</description>
