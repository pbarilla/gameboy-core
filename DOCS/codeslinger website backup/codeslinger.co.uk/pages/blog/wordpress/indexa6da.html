		<description>Thanks a lot for your work and tutorials you have made. I was just thinking to write an emulator since 2008, but now i have made CHIP8 emulator after reading your CHIP8 emulator. I clearly understood the logic behind emulation which i was afraid of before.

I make games but wanted to run NSF music into my S60 5th edition Nokia phone. So i started to learn NES seriously. Now am working on 6502 and 230A emulation. 

At present i can put a link on my site for your tutorials and site as credit.

Thanks a lot again. ;-) Thumbs up for your sincere efforts.</description>

		<description>When i studied your emulator, i found something (may be an error)
m_CyclesThisUpdate += 8 ;
instead of + 16
see below

// shift right. bit 0 into carry
void Emulator::CPU_SRL_MEMORY(WORD address)
{
	//WHEN EDITING THIS FUNCTION ALSO EDIT CPU_SRL

	m_CyclesThisUpdate += 8 ;

"should be increased by 16 no ?
...

I was just wondering, has this site been backburnered? It's been a while, and I am just worried this great resource will be lost. I was looking forward to Zuko too...</description>

		<description>Hi. I'm using your work with the master system as a reference to my final project. Do you have some way that I can contact you? Email or something? I need your name to give credits (if you would like to allow me to use it).
Thank you.</description>

		<description>Hey Codeslinger.
Do you think you will be releasing a tutorial on Gameboy sound emulation soon? Sorry to bug you, it's just an area in emulation that I'm not familier with. 

thanks :)</description>
