					<p>Well sourceforge accepted my project. The project is called Zuko and its website can be found <a href="http://zuko.sourceforge.net/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Zuko is a multi game console emulator. At first it will fully emulate the Gameboy, Sega Master System and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. However this is not the main reason for Zuko being created. With all the next generation consoles being released (XBOX 360, playstation 3 etc) in my opinion the emulation scene is struggling to survive. It is no longer possible for one programmer to emulate nextgen consoles. It will take a team of talented emulator programmers years to do. Zuko&#8217;s main purpose is to make the learning curve from new emulator programmers less steep so they can develop the skills needed for the emulation scene to continue.</p>
<p>Zuko will allow the user to debug the ROMS and give them control over the console. It will have a tile and sprite viewer and allow the user to change their attributes (flips and zooms etc) as well as controlling the scrolling and the palette. The user can also edit the game speed and control the interupts. They will be able to view the register states as well as changing them to see how they affect the games. There will also be a lot more options aswell as being able to control the way the emulator works, for example switching between Interpreter to Binary Translation along with dynamic recompilation and threaded interpretation. The project will be completely open source and I will supply the svn repository details for Zuko and all the individual emulators. When I get the svn repo set up I&#8217;ll post the link straight away so you can all check my progress. I plan to completely finish the Gameboy, Master System and Mega Drive emulators first before integrating them into Zuko.</p>
<p>Future version of Zuko will support NES and the Nintendo 64 (now that will be one hell of a project!). </p>
<p>Oh and also Zuko can be used for a normal emulator to relive gaming classics! Like all my other emulators it will be programmed in C++ and will run under Windows and GNU/Linux.</p>
<p>Finally these are the two screenshots I promised in my last post</p>

					<p>I am currently awaiting permission from sourceforge to host my emulation project. When and if they accept I&#8217;ll put the svn details of my master system emulator on here so you can keep track of my progress. Read permissions only of course <img src='wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>If I get this sourceforge project it will be more than just a master system emulator. I&#8217;ll explain more when they have accepted the project. Fingers crossed.</p>
<p>On a side note I have two master system games emulating up to the first screen display. These games are &#8220;Great Soccer&#8221; and &#8220;Ghost House&#8221;.</p>
<p>Screenshots coming soon.</p>

				<small>Saturday, August 23rd, 2008</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>I&#8217;ve made a bit of progress on my master system in the last 24 hours. So far I&#8217;ve managed to get 2 VDP test roms running perfectly, a third test rom running but with glitches and the Z80 CPU Instruction Exerciser ROM running. So far the Z80 Instruction Exerciser ROM runs but every instruction check fails. This is not because all the instructions are incorrect (because if that was the case I&#8217;d never see any ROMS load), so I guess the problem is with the checking algorithm it uses. I must have implemented one of the opcodes incorrectly which does the checking, therefore everything appears to be incorrect. Hopefully soon I can upload some screenshots of either a game screen or the Z80 Instruction Exerciser passing some tests.</p>

				<small>Monday, August 18th, 2008</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>Over the past few days I&#8217;ve had a few hours spare to start reading about the sega master system. The CPU is a Z80 which is what the Gameboy CPU is similar to, so I have already implemented 50% of the instructions. I have found the website <a href="http://www.smspower.org/dev/docs/">SMS Power</a> very useful for the SMS documentation. Unlike the gameboy there is not one document which covers everything you need to emulate the SMS so I&#8217;m using about 7 different resources to learn from, which I quite like doing really as it feels less spoon fed this way.</p>
<p>When I first started looking into emulating the Z80 I thought it would be easier than the Gameboy because of the fewer interupts and I found the gameboy quite quirky, however this is not the case. The other 50% of the Z80 cpu instructions I have to implement are more complicated than the 50% I&#8217;ve already implemented. Plus there are another 5 flags that need to be set correctly. The 0xFD and 0xDD opcodes make the cpu feel quite bloated aswell. The VDP seems much more complicated than the Gameboy and so do the way the interupts work. I&#8217;m still confident that I can finish this system in two months including sound but only if I have the time to do work on it, but it wont be as easy as I first thought.</p>
<p>I have got a few test roms from that SMS Power site which I have emulated all the opcodes for, so now I just need to get the VDP showing something for them. Once I have emulated the VDP I should be able to run ZEXALL which is a Z80 test rom, which will be really usefull for eliminating cpu bugs.</p>
<p>Fun fun fun</p>
