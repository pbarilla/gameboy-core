					<p>Well this week I&#8217;ve entered a world of pain with my emulator debugger. First of all I had to debug street fighter to see why it wasnt working and it turned out that it was relying on the reading of the mapper control registers (0xFFFC-0xFFFF) to return the values of the mapped address of 0xDFFC-0xDFFF. As soon as I put this into the game I had immediate success.</p>
<p>I finally managed to get mode 2 sprite emulation working which was down to a really stupid error on my part.</p>
<p>Finally I&#8217;ve been debugging why my code masters larger res screen doesnt work and why the graphics are screwy in mortal kombat.</p>
<p>Luckily for me they were both the same error. The error was with my 8 and 16 bit opcodes for adc and sbc. Now this is how I emulated 8 bit adc (for when adding register c to register a):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>BYTE before = m_RegisterAF.hi ;<br />
BYTE toAdd = m_RegisterBC.lo ;</em></p>
<p><em>if (isCarrySet)<br />
toAdd++ ;</em></p>
<p><em>m_RegisterAF.hi += toAdd ;</em></p>
<p><em>if ((before + toAdd) &gt; 0xFF)<br />
SetCarryFlag() ;<br />
else<br />
ResetCarryFlag() ;</em></p>
<p><em>// code to work out the other flags </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Can you spot whats wrong with the above code?</p>
<p>Solution:<br />
At first glance this looks fine however think what would happen if register C was 0xFF? When the carry gets added the toAdd variable wraps back round to 0. So register a stays set to 0xFF which is correct, however the setting of the c flag never gets set. This was causing the following instruction in mortal kombat (jump if carry is set) to fail.</p>
<p>That took me ages to find!</p>
<p>However both mortal kombat and micro machines are playable. My main concern now is why half of the games I play suffer from graphic flicker&#8230;. Better get my debugger back out.</p>
<p>Fortunately this is the last of the big bugs that need debugging and then it&#8217;s on to sound emulation (oh joy). However the end feels just round the corner.</p>

					<p>If any of you are writing a Z80 emulator then take it from me dont rely on zexall too much. If zexalls output says you have a bug then you most definately do. However if it says that the test went ok it doesnt mean that they are bug free.</p>
<p>I managed to fix a bug in my emulator without zexalls help which was causing a few games to display the background incorrectly. Mainly Lemmings and Land of Illusion. This bug has been haunting me for awhile so im quite relieved to have fixed it.</p>
<p>I have recently found out that some games run at the wrong speed with my emulator so after checking all my opcodes to see if they are emulating their cycles correctly I was left with the conclusion it must be an error with my vsync emultion. Sure enough I wasnt moving on to the next scanline quick enough which was causing too few vsync interrupts to occur which is one of the main way speed is controlled in games. This is now fixed (after a day of headache) and all games play at the correct speed ( or should I say all tested games? <img src='wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> )</p>
<p>Over the past few days I have also emulated the none maskable reset interrupt, the different screen resolution controlled by the current vdp mode and the codemasters mapper. Although the codemasters mapper is implemented correctly the majority of the games show issues with background rendering. However I believe this to be a problem with the background rendering routine rather than the mapper iteself because there is not much room for error with the mapper (compared to the sega mapper anyway).</p>
