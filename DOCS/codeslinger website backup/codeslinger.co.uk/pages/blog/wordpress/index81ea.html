					<p>Well I have implemented all 4 channels and individually they sound correct. When I combine them though there is a serious issue. Although I can still hear each channel playing correctly it is like the mixing is causing the seperate channels to be playing at the wrong volume. Still it shouldnt be too long until I have it working. Expect a gameboy sound tutorial soon. Im hoping to be on to my Sega Mega Drive/Genesis emulator by the start of June</p>

					<p>Well I have finally started sound emulation for the gameboy and am finding it much more difficult than the SMS. There really seems to be a lack of sound emulation resources on the net. For the time being I am only emulating the two square waves as I have experience with how these work from the SMS. Although I have implemented everything to do with the square waves it still isnt producing the correct tune. The beat seems correct but the notes are completely off. Still encouraging though as this was exactly how my SMS sounded a day or two before I cracked it.</p>
<p>On a slightly annoying note my trunk svn gameboy dev seems to have a few bugs in the vdp and cpu that have appeared out of nowhere. I might look into redeveloping my Gameboy emulator when I have finished the sound as the knowledge I have gained from developing the SMS I feel I could take it to the next level. Still I&#8217;m getting impatient to start my mega drive/genesis emulator&#8230;</p>

					<p>Well over the past few days I&#8217;ve been writing a draft for this blog about the Gameboy LCD. However I&#8217;ve just fixed a bug in my emulator that has given me 95% compatibility (without sound). So instead of continuing discussing gameboy emulation in this blog I will complete the Gameboy howto section on my <a href="../../../../www.codeslinger.co.uk/index.html">website</a> which will explain how to successfully emulate all parts of the gameboy aswell as hosting my source code (just the same as what I did with the chip8). There are two notable bugs in the emulator. The first is with kirby&#8217;s dream land, the enemies seem to vanish. The second is with monopoly which has a terrible flicker when viewing the property card. Apart from this the all games are completeable with the occassional graphic glitch.</p>
<p>I shall continue to use this blog, but from now on it will be about exploring how to emulate the master system which at the time of writing I havent even looked into.</p>
<p>You may be wondering if im ever going to implement sound for the gameboy. I have read that the master system sound is easier to do than the gameboy and as I have no knowledge of sound emulation I was going to complete the master system and then come back to the gameboy.</p>

					<p>So far my emulator has the following working:</p>
<ul>
<li>Timers</li>
<li>Divider</li>
<li>LCD Status</li>
<li>Interupt Handling</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ve yet to post on how to emulate the LCD Status (moderate difficulty) and Interupt Handling (easy). Hopefully I&#8217;ll get time to write a detailed post on this later on today.</p>
<p>So far my emulator is dumping the following information when running every second:</p>
<blockquote><p>
There has been: 4194304 clock cycles<br />
There has been: 60 vblanks<br />
There has been: 16 timer interupts<br />
There has been: 64 divider overflows
</p></blockquote>
<p>The timer is set to a frequency of 4096Hz and the TMA is set to 0. So far everything seems to be working perfectly. Just input and graphic emulation until I start work on the opcode emulation. I always prefer writing the hardware emulation before the opcode emulation because in my opinion it is the harder of the two. So I like to get it right before moving on.</p>

				<small>Wednesday, July 16th, 2008</small>

					<p>This is very similar to the Timer register (TIMA) only much easier. The divider register (DIV) is located at memory address 0xFF04 and one of its uses is to supply a seed for a random number generator in games. You can test this by not emulating the divider register and then playing tetris. You will notice that the only object you are given in tetris is the square block which makes the game a bit easy. The register increments itself through values of 0-255 and starts back at 0 again when going one higher than 255. You need to intercept the write to the DIV address. When the game attempts to write to DIV then DIV is set to 0.</p>
<p>So how do we emulate this? We need to set up a divider tracer variable which increments the div register at 16384Hz. The clock speed is 4.194304MHz which is 256 times faster than the divider register. So each timer the cpu does 256 clock cycles the div register gets incremented.</p>
<p>This gives the following emulation code needed to implement the divider register:</p>
<p>click <a href="examples/divider.txt">here</a> for a text version of the divider example. As usual feel free to comment on any questions you have or any problems you see with the code.</p>

					<p>One of the most important parts of emulator development is the timing emulation. If you get the timing wrong then you will suffer from very low compatibility.</p>
<p>This is the information I have about gameboy timing:</p>
<p>Processor Speed: 1048576Hz (PROCESSORSPEED)</p>
<p>Clock Speed: 4194304Hz (CLOCKSPEED)</p>
<p>It has one timer located at memory address 0xFF05 (TIMA) which counts up at a set frequency. The frequency is dictated by combining bits 1 and 0 of memory address 0xFF07 (TAC) which is the timer control register. Bit 2 of TAC is responsible for stopping and starting the timer (TIMA).</p>
<p>As previously stated combining bit 1 and 0 of TAC specifies the TIMA frequency. These are the frequencies:</p>
<p>00:   4096 Hz</p>
<p>01: 262144 Hz</p>
<p>10:  65536 Hz</p>
<p>11:  16384 Hz</p>
<p>As the TIMA is an unsigned byte it can only count between values of 0 and 255. So when it goes higher than 255 it sets its value to the value stored in the register 0xFF06(TMA) and requests the timer interupt. </p>
<p>All the above information needs to be successfully emulated to give high compatibility. This is how Im going coding it.</p>
<p>I have set my emulator to have a frames per second (FPS) count of 60. This means I must execute <strong>CLOCKSPEED / FPS</strong> number of instruction cycles every 60th of a second. This will give me 4194304Hz of clock cycles every second.</p>
<p>Thats the gameboy timing emulated but what about the gameboy timer? If we take frequency 4096Hz this means the timer increments its value 4096 times a second. As the timer counts between 0 and 255 it must overflow 16 times a second (4096/256). This is handy to know so we can check it is counting at the correct frequency. However how do we know when we need to increment the timer? The clockspeed is 4194304Hz and the frequency is 4096Hz. This means that roughly every 1024 clock cycles the timer increments by 1. So if we have a variable for timer counting (m_TimerTracer) that is initially set to 1024 and each timer we execute an opcode we decrease this variable by the amount of clock cycles the opcode took to execute then when this variable is less than or equal to 0 it is time to incrememt the timer. Of course we only do all of this if bit 2 of TAC is set to 1 (meaning the timer is enabled). This is fine for frequency 4096 but what about the other 3 frequencies? Well whenever the game changes TAC register bits 1 and 0 then m_TimerTracer gets reset to CLOCKSPEED/FREQUENCY. So whenever the game writes to address TAC we need to check that the current frequency is different to the new frequency and if so we change m_TimerTracer to CLOCKSPEED/FREQUENCY.</p>
<p>Putting all of the above information together gives the following emulation code:</p>
<p>Click <a href="examples/timer.txt">here</a> for a txt version of the code. This code here only shows how to emulate the parts discussed in this post. If you have any questions or comments then please feel free to post below.</p>
