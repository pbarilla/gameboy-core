		<description>Hey!
I just recently found your site and I gotta say: Thanks for keeping this material around! I've always been interested in emulation but the scarcity of documentation put me off coding my own emulator until now. But now, I've managed to code my own CHIP-8 emulator and am in the process of redesigning it for code clarity and SCHIP capabilities (plus some fluff :) ). After that, I'm set on following your tutorials through a Gameboy emulator in the same way! So thanks a ton for providing the materials!</description>
