			<h2>Debugging an emulator is a pain</h2>

			<div class="entry">
				<p>Well this week I&#8217;ve entered a world of pain with my emulator debugger. First of all I had to debug street fighter to see why it wasnt working and it turned out that it was relying on the reading of the mapper control registers (0xFFFC-0xFFFF) to return the values of the mapped address of 0xDFFC-0xDFFF. As soon as I put this into the game I had immediate success.</p>
<p>I finally managed to get mode 2 sprite emulation working which was down to a really stupid error on my part.</p>
<p>Finally I&#8217;ve been debugging why my code masters larger res screen doesnt work and why the graphics are screwy in mortal kombat.</p>
<p>Luckily for me they were both the same error. The error was with my 8 and 16 bit opcodes for adc and sbc. Now this is how I emulated 8 bit adc (for when adding register c to register a):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>BYTE before = m_RegisterAF.hi ;<br />
BYTE toAdd = m_RegisterBC.lo ;</em></p>
<p><em>if (isCarrySet)<br />
toAdd++ ;</em></p>
<p><em>m_RegisterAF.hi += toAdd ;</em></p>
<p><em>if ((before + toAdd) &gt; 0xFF)<br />
SetCarryFlag() ;<br />
else<br />
ResetCarryFlag() ;</em></p>
<p><em>// code to work out the other flags </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Can you spot whats wrong with the above code?</p>
<p>Solution:<br />
At first glance this looks fine however think what would happen if register C was 0xFF? When the carry gets added the toAdd variable wraps back round to 0. So register a stays set to 0xFF which is correct, however the setting of the c flag never gets set. This was causing the following instruction in mortal kombat (jump if carry is set) to fail.</p>
<p>That took me ages to find!</p>
<p>However both mortal kombat and micro machines are playable. My main concern now is why half of the games I play suffer from graphic flicker&#8230;. Better get my debugger back out.</p>
<p>Fortunately this is the last of the big bugs that need debugging and then it&#8217;s on to sound emulation (oh joy). However the end feels just round the corner.</p>
