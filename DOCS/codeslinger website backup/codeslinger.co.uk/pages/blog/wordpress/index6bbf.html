					<p>I havent had much time to work on my emulator over the past week. However I have just managed to get zexall running the first few instructions fine. It breaks when it encounters an opcode I havent implemented which is not suprising <img src='wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>With zexall working hopefully it wont be long until I have a fully working z80 emulator.</p>
<p>Heres a screenshot of my emulator running zexall in debug mode (hence slow fps). I have no idea why the first character of the ouput isnt working but that&#8217;ll just be a small bug in my vdp emulation which is far from finished.</p>

					<p>I&#8217;ve made a bit of progress on my master system in the last 24 hours. So far I&#8217;ve managed to get 2 VDP test roms running perfectly, a third test rom running but with glitches and the Z80 CPU Instruction Exerciser ROM running. So far the Z80 Instruction Exerciser ROM runs but every instruction check fails. This is not because all the instructions are incorrect (because if that was the case I&#8217;d never see any ROMS load), so I guess the problem is with the checking algorithm it uses. I must have implemented one of the opcodes incorrectly which does the checking, therefore everything appears to be incorrect. Hopefully soon I can upload some screenshots of either a game screen or the Z80 Instruction Exerciser passing some tests.</p>

					<p>Over the past few days I&#8217;ve had a few hours spare to start reading about the sega master system. The CPU is a Z80 which is what the Gameboy CPU is similar to, so I have already implemented 50% of the instructions. I have found the website <a href="http://www.smspower.org/dev/docs/">SMS Power</a> very useful for the SMS documentation. Unlike the gameboy there is not one document which covers everything you need to emulate the SMS so I&#8217;m using about 7 different resources to learn from, which I quite like doing really as it feels less spoon fed this way.</p>
<p>When I first started looking into emulating the Z80 I thought it would be easier than the Gameboy because of the fewer interupts and I found the gameboy quite quirky, however this is not the case. The other 50% of the Z80 cpu instructions I have to implement are more complicated than the 50% I&#8217;ve already implemented. Plus there are another 5 flags that need to be set correctly. The 0xFD and 0xDD opcodes make the cpu feel quite bloated aswell. The VDP seems much more complicated than the Gameboy and so do the way the interupts work. I&#8217;m still confident that I can finish this system in two months including sound but only if I have the time to do work on it, but it wont be as easy as I first thought.</p>
<p>I have got a few test roms from that SMS Power site which I have emulated all the opcodes for, so now I just need to get the VDP showing something for them. Once I have emulated the VDP I should be able to run ZEXALL which is a Z80 test rom, which will be really usefull for eliminating cpu bugs.</p>
<p>Fun fun fun</p>
