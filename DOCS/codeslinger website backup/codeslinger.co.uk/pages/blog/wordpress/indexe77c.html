					<p>I&#8217;ve had a lot less time available lately to work on my emulator which is why im progressing slower than I thought I would. However I have recently completely fixed scrolling as well as adding tile priorities and the backdrop colour. Zexall complains that there are many bugs in my z80 (all flag related).</p>
<p>The good news is I&#8217;ve added input emulation which is much simpler than it is on the gameboy. Now sonic is completely playable. I&#8217;ve played up to the third level without anything going wrong which is great. Hopefully I&#8217;ll have time to play it fully to see how far I get. Hopefully the game is completeable.</p>
<p>Im having luck with a lot of other games too like Alex Kidd which is also playable. Some games like Woody Pop doesnt even show the first screen which I find worrying because I have no idea whats going wrong. If I had to have a stab in the dark I&#8217;d guess that its related to VDP modes which im not handling yet.</p>
<p>Anyway the rest of the day I&#8217;ll try and make zexall happier with my z80 emulation and maybe look into whats envolved with these vdp modes.</p>

					<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>I have managed to get all of the standard opcodes implemented along with all CB, ED, DDCB and FDCB prefixes. I have a lot of the DD and FD opcodes left to implement though.</p>
<p>I have improved the scrolling of the background but still got some graphical glitches to iron out.</p>
<p>The good news is that I have had massive improvement in the amount of games showing their first screen (mainly because I&#8217;ve implemented the ED and DDCB opcodes). Hopefully when I finish the DD and FD opcodes I should be able to play in game.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots of how it&#8217;s looking at the moment. You can see the graphical glitches on Alex Kidd as he has a black box surrounding him. This is either priority or transparency that im not implementing correctly.</p>

					<p>I havent had much time to work on my emulator over the past week. However I have just managed to get zexall running the first few instructions fine. It breaks when it encounters an opcode I havent implemented which is not suprising <img src='wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>With zexall working hopefully it wont be long until I have a fully working z80 emulator.</p>
<p>Heres a screenshot of my emulator running zexall in debug mode (hence slow fps). I have no idea why the first character of the ouput isnt working but that&#8217;ll just be a small bug in my vdp emulation which is far from finished.</p>
