		<description>Hi, I couldn't find anywhere else to contact you, so I'll leave this here.

Thank you very much for producing this site, it has been very useful to me. It is about time somebody wrote tutorials on emulator programming with specific examples, rather than just generic emulation concepts and your site is exactly that.

I was planning (and still do) to write some emulator programming tutorials on my blog once I get my head around some of the concepts. I had already written a Chip8 emulator and was planning to write a Gameboy emulator before I found your site, but was struggling with where to begin with the Gameboy emu. Thanks again for providing this great resource.
