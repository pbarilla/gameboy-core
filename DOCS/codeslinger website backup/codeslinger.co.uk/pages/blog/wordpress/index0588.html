		<description>Thanks a lot for your work and tutorials you have made. I was just thinking to write an emulator since 2008, but now i have made CHIP8 emulator after reading your CHIP8 emulator. I clearly understood the logic behind emulation which i was afraid of before.

I make games but wanted to run NSF music into my S60 5th edition Nokia phone. So i started to learn NES seriously. Now am working on 6502 and 230A emulation. 

At present i can put a link on my site for your tutorials and site as credit.

Thanks a lot again. ;-) Thumbs up for your sincere efforts.</description>

		<description>Hey!

I was just wondering, has this site been backburnered? It's been a while, and I am just worried this great resource will be lost. I was looking forward to Zuko too...</description>

		<description>Hi. I'm using your work with the master system as a reference to my final project. Do you have some way that I can contact you? Email or something? I need your name to give credits (if you would like to allow me to use it).
Thank you.</description>

		<description>Hey Codeslinger.
Do you think you will be releasing a tutorial on Gameboy sound emulation soon? Sorry to bug you, it's just an area in emulation that I'm not familier with. 

thanks :)</description>

		<description>Awesome place, thank you very much for all your tutorials, source code and great info. I hope we are working on the Mega Drive / Genesis emulator and don't leave the updates of the site.</description>

		<description>Just to note; I realise now why the 'SetLCDStatus' needs to be called every ‘UpdateGraphics’ call.</description>

		<description>Hi,

I think your GameBoy LCD tutorial and 'finished product' both have a bug which causes the first scaline to never be rendered. The screenshots of your emulator on the GameBoy page seem to confirm this.

The bug:
m_Rom[0xFF44]++; &#60;--is always called _before_ rendering a scanline, thus scanline 0 can never be rendered.

Also, I'm wondering if 'SetLCDStatus' is being called at the right time, and if it really needs to be called every time 'UpdateGraphics' is executed or just when m_ScalineCounter &#60;= 0.

Thanks,
Lee.</description>

		<description>Thanks loads codeslinger for all the walkthroughs on your site, it is invaluable. Hopefully, I will actually get the graphics fully working on my chip8 emulator soon, its all down to you, thanks again.</description>
